Financial Dashboard Project
This project delivers a dynamic and insightful Financial Dashboard, built to transform raw financial data into actionable business intelligence. Leveraging a robust dataset, this dashboard provides a clear overview of sales, gross sales, profit, and cost of goods sold (COGS), along with detailed breakdowns by country, segment, and product.

About This Project
This Financial Dashboard is designed for business analysts, financial professionals, and decision-makers who need quick, comprehensive insights into their company's financial performance. It visualizes key metrics, identifies top-performing products and segments, and highlights sales trends over time and across different regions. The goal is to empower users to make data-driven decisions swiftly and effectively.
